Simulation and visualisation of path-dependent random walks. 
Despite a positive expectation value, the time average diverges negatively. 
First, iteration and additivity are introduced and quickly compared to random multiplicative processes.

Additionally, an analytic expression of the difference between the arithmetic and the geometric mean is presented.
